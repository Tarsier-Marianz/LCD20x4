# LCD20x4 -Arduino

Collection of samples and experiments using 20x4 Character LCD in [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/).



* `LCD20x4_Progressbar` - a simple example on how to create progressbar in 20x4 LCD using created custom characters. 

* `LCD20x4_BitmapBar` - originally, code from [Arduino Playground Site](https://playground.arduino.cc/Code/LCDBitmap). Added in my repo as my future references, hmm?.. maybe, *Someday!*.
